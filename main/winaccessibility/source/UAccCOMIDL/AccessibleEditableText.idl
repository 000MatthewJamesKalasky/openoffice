/** @brief This interface gives write access to a text representation.

 This interface is typically used in conjunction with the IAccessibleText 
  interface and complements that interface with the additional ability to 
  modify text.

 The substrings used with this interface are specified as follows:
  If startOffset is less than endOffset, the substring starts with the 
  character at startOffset and ends with the character just before endOffset.
  If endOffset is lower than startOffset,  the result is the same as a call 
  with the two arguments exchanged. The whole text can be defined by passing 
  the indices zero and IAccessibleText::nCharacters. If both indices have the 
  same value, an empty string is defined.
